### ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Settings
Customize everything through Obsidian's settings interface:
- Enable or disable specific features
- Configure Prettier formatting options (synchronized with lint rules)
- Set your preferred lint rules (26+ configurable options)
- Choose when formatting happens (on-demand or on-save)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Start Simple
Enable just a few rules at first, then add more as you get comfortable with the plugin.

### Use Format on Save
For a seamless experience, enable "Format on save" to automatically clean up your notes as you work.

### Customize to Your Style
There's no "perfect" markdown style‚Äîconfigure the plugin to match how you like to write.

### Lint Before Important Exports
Run a quick lint check before exporting or publishing your notes to ensure everything looks professional.

## Technical Details

### Linting Engine
This plugin uses **markdownlint** (v0.38.0+), the industry-standard markdown linter with 50+ professional rules (MD001-MD059). Previously used remark-lint, migrated for better rule coverage and auto-fix capabilities.

### Formatter-Linter Integration
The plugin implements intelligent coordination between Prettier and markdownlint:
- Settings are automatically synchronized (printWidth ‚Üî MD013, tabWidth ‚Üî MD007, useTabs ‚Üî MD010)
- "Format and Lint Document" command prevents conflicts by running Prettier first, then automatically applying lint fixes
- Includes custom fix handlers for edge cases (oversized code fences, empty code blocks)

### Language Support
Comprehensive code language detection and configuration:
- 200+ supported languages via modular `codeLanguages.ts` architecture
- Supports GitHub Linguist, highlight.js, and Prism.js identifiers
- 20 language categories: Web, Mobile, Scientific, Systems, Data Science, DevOps, etc.
- Custom input field for any language identifier not in dropdown

### Auto-Format Behavior
Format-on-save triggers on file modification events (not editor changes) to prevent disruption during typing. Preserves cursor position and scroll state after formatting using stored editor state restoration.

### Dependencies
- markdownlint: ^0.38.0 (linting engine)
- prettier: ^3.4.2 (formatting engine)
- 193 total npm packages (reduced from 225 after remark-lint removal)

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Working?
1. Make sure the plugin is enabled in Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
2. Try reloading Obsidian (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
3. Check if your file is a supported format (.md, .markdown, .mdx)

### Formatting Looks Wrong?
1. Check your Format Settings to adjust Prettier options
2. Remember: YAML front matter is intentionally excluded from formatting
3. If Prettier and markdownlint conflict, use "Format and Lint Document" command which synchronizes both automatically

### Lint Errors Seem Incorrect?
1. Review your Lint Rules in settings
2. Disable specific rules you don't need
3. Some issues may not be auto-fixable and require manual correction
4. Check if formatter settings are synchronized (printWidth, tabWidth, useTabs)
